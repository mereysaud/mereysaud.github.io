	<h3>The Story</h3>
    <p>“Another friend died in Manus Island today… He died because the Australian government didn’t care,” wrote Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani, in a Twitter post from behind the walls of Manus Regional Processing Centre; formerly one of Australia’s two offshore immigration detention center facilities until its closure in November 2017.</p>
		<p>The 34-year-old dissident fled his home country Iran after being targeted by the Sepah for his political activism. In August 2013 he embarked on a perilous illegal boat journey from Indonesia to Australia, only to reach its inviting sandy shores and immediately be transferred to Manus Island. According to the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Boochani’s story echoes that of the 791 male refugees formerly detained on Manus Island and the 280 men, women & children still detained on Nauru.</p>
		<p>After a ruling by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court found the detention of asylum seekers and refugees to be illegal and in breach of Papua New Guinea’s constitution, the Australian government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-37104363">announced the permanent closure</a>of Manus Regional Processing Centre. By the end of October 2017, the refugees – most of whom have called Manus home for an average of four years – were forced to return to their country of origin or to relocate to Nauru. A lucky few, however, found themselves being offered resettlement in the United States.</p>
		<p>This offer stems from what is being referred to as a “refugee deal” brokered by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Obama administration in 2016, in which it was agreed that the United States would resettle 1250 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centres, and in return Australia would resettle refugees from a US detention centre in Costa Rica. An estimated 370 formerly detained men and women from Nauru and Manus Island have already made their way to the United States to be resettled across several states. However, it remains unclear whether the Trump administration will honor the deal in its entirety. In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/australia-mexico-transcripts/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b3300f5e5241">leaked phone call to Turnbull</a> in January 2017, Trump referred to the deal as “stupid” and one that shows him to be a “dope”.</p>
		<p>With the limited Internet connectivity provided at Manus, Boochani has been able to regularly post updates to his <a href="https://twitter.com/behrouzboochani">Twitter</a>, where he has amassed a following of more than 27 000 people. “About 150 people who received positive refugee status have not yet had any interview for America and we don’t know what will happen to them,” wrote Boochani. The UNHCR has long held the position that the processing center on Manus Island reflects “conditions that do not meet the international standards of treatment.”</p>

		<p>Since the implementation of Australia’s controversial zero tolerance border protection operation in 2013 - often referred to as the Stop The Boats policy – the question of what to do with refugees who are turned away from Australian shores has plagued the government. This has only heightened over the past three years following clashes between refugees and locals on both Nauru and Manus Island, and strong condemnation from the international community.</p>
		<p>Julia Morris, a British political anthropologist and the Post-doctoral Fellow at The New School’s Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility, completed extensive fieldwork in the Republic of Nauru in 2015. “It was horrible. All anyone ever talked about was what was going to happen in the future. No one I spoke with imagined that they would be stuck on a 21 kilometre-squared island. They all thought that they were going to get to Australia,” she said. “A lot of refugees in Nauru knew that the only way to give visibility to their situation was if they engaged in quite dramatic acts like settling themselves on fire or self-harming, because that was the kind of thing that activists in Australia would then circulate to the media, and then the media would disseminate that. Otherwise it was hard to bring to light the situation.”</p>
		<p>“The Nauruan and the Australian governments were trying to shop around and trying to find somewhere far enough away where it would
appease the international community,” Morris said, of the origins of the US-Australia Refugee Deal. “[They] knew that they had to work with another country that would appease people, so the US was a perfect one because it was far enough away and it’s a limited one-time deal. They quite explicitly said this is only going to be a one-off thing.”</p>
		<p>The Australian government is no stranger to ‘trading off’ refugees. In 2011 the High Court of Australia <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-australia-malaysia-idUKTRE77U0OD20110831">ruled against a signed agreement</a> between Australia and Malaysia that would have seen Malaysia accept 800 asylum seekers and in return Australia a rollout of 4000 refugees over the following four years. “UNHCR actually agreed to be contracted into refugee determination, but then there was this really big High Court case which squashed that as an option because Malaysia hadn’t signed the Refugee Convention. And because a lot of activists all came together and they circulated these discourses around Malaysians as refugee-beaters,” explained Morris.</p>
		<p>“They have the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-06/australia-remains-committed-to-refugee-resettlement-in-cambodia/9228838">Cambodia deal</a> so that is still an option,” she added, referring to the $55 million investment made by the Australian government, in the hope that refugees in Nauru would choose to resettle in Cambodia. “That just didn’t go down well with NGOs in Australia who then mounted another anti-civilizational attack on Cambodians, saying Cambodia is rife with human rights abuse,” Morris explained. Since 2014 all of seven refugees have taken the offer up.</p>
		<p>It seems the opportunity to be resettled in the United States follows a similar train of thought for refugees currently being vetted. “I had an email from a refugee in Nauru who was freaked out about the idea of going to the U.S. So many people don’t actually want to go to the U.S. People were saying it’s like non refoulement - you know, ‘I’m from Iran, how am I going to be treated in a country that’s just placed a travel ban on Iran?’” said Morris.</p>
		<p>As of yet, the Trump administration has not given any indication of when or how many more refugees are expected to make the journey across to the
United States, if any at all.</p>
